                        explanation: "Bonding in gas piping systems refers to the permanent joining of metallic parts to form an electrically conductive path. This is crucial for safety because it prevents static electricity buildup and provides a path for electrical current in case of electrical faults.",
                        example: "In a commercial kitchen installation, all metal gas piping must be bonded to the building's electrical grounding system. This prevents dangerous voltage differences between metal components and ensures electrical safety.",
                        codeReference: "According to CSA B149.1 and the Canadian Electrical Code, continuous metal gas piping systems must be bonded when electrical power is present in the building.",
                        commonMistake: "A common mistake is thinking bonding is the same as welding pipe sections together. Bonding is specifically about electrical connectivity, not physical joining of pipes."

                    'pressure': {
                        explanation: "Pressure drop calculations are fundamental to proper gas system sizing. Commercial/industrial systems typically allow higher pressure drops than residential systems because they operate at higher inlet pressures.",
                        example: "A restaurant with multiple gas appliances might operate at 2 psig inlet pressure, allowing for greater pressure drops while still maintaining adequate pressure at each appliance. Residential systems typically operate at 7-14 inches w.c., requiring more restrictive pressure drop limits.",
                        codeReference: "CSA B149.1 provides detailed pressure drop calculations based on pipe size, length, and gas flow requirements.",
                        commonMistake: "Assuming residential and commercial systems have the same pressure drop requirements can lead to undersized piping and poor appliance performance."
                    },
                    'testing': {
                        explanation: "Gas piping systems require different types of tests at different stages. The first pressure test is performed before appliances are connected to verify the integrity of the piping system itself.",
                        example: "During construction, after installing all gas piping but before connecting any appliances, the system is pressure tested with air or inert gas to ensure there are no leaks in the piping network. Final leak tests are performed after appliances are connected.",
                        codeReference: "CSA B149.1 specifies test pressures and durations based on operating pressure ranges and system size.",
                        commonMistake: "Confusing the initial pressure test with the final leak test can result in improper testing procedures and potential safety hazards."
